#### A jQuery, CSS Transitions, and AJAX Demonstration
This sleek, cleanly styled site pops subtle transitions on break-points to give it emphasis. It's brought to life when content populates the story grid with a dramatic fly-away transition that reduces the size of the header to a slim branding across the top.

## Modern, Mobile-First Design
This minimalist design brings a user's focus to the primary function of this site which is to find and retrieve content from the New York Times API.

Part of mobile-first design is ensuring all content is displayed and that hover is used only on other devices. Once a choice is made in the selection box, the header retreats to reveal one story and suggestively show the top of the second, prompting the mobile user to engage with the site.

##jQuery, AJAX, and Nice Select 
jQuery and AJAX were used to access the New York Times API, to filter and validate the results returned, and to build the grid of elements which was styled and animated using CSS.

jQuery Nice Select was used as an easy solution for a custom dropdown menu.

## Optimized for Tablet and Deskstop
Similarly sleek, the site stays focused on its primary function in both tablet and desktop.

However once a search is entered, the header dramatically flies away while javascript builds the content into the page and CSS styles either a 2x6 grid (tablet) or a 4x3 grid (desktop) as pixels allow based on the look.

Hover functionality is built in to reveal headlines only when the user hovers over (mouses over) the picture, again prompting the user to actively engage with the site.
